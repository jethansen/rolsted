This time-consuming process requires my full devotion and calls for calmness, concentration - and lots of good coffee. Away goes everyday noise and worries as I draw the first line... <br/><br/> My drawings are inspired by the way I feel about art and life in general - that I like to keep things simple, savior the little moments while leaving some room for natural imperfection. <br/><br/><br/><br/>I hope one of my drawings will find its way and bring life to your wall."
