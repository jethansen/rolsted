I draw illustrations based on simple lines and geometric shapes. A minimal, nordic style created directly from pen to paper. In other words, once the line is drawn, thereâ€™s no going back. This time-consuming process requires my full devotion and calls for calmness, concentration - and lots of good coffee. Away goes everyday noise and worries as I draw the first line...

My drawings are inspired by the way I feel about art and life in general - that I like to keep things simple, savior the little moments while leaving some room for natural imperfection.

I hope one of my drawings will find its way and bring life to your wall.
